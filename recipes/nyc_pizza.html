    <p>Recipe by <i>Adam Ragusea</i></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>New York-style pizza dough is an offshoot of Neapolitan-style doughâ€”still a thin crust pie, but slightly thicker than its Italian cousin. 
        The crust is sturdy, but not cracker-like, and instead features a tender chew thanks to the addition of oil in the dough. 
        Using a food processor brings the dough together in 30 seconds flat, which is ready to bake the next day, so anyone can enjoy a city slice at home.

    <p><strong>Recipe, makes four pizzas!</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>530ml warm water</li>
                <li>12g sugar</li>
                <li>9g active dry yeast</li>
                <li>30ml olive oil + additional for greasing the dough</li>
                <li>18g salt</li>
                <li>600g bread flour + additional for working the dough</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>830ml can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>30-60ml olive oil</li>
                <li>4g sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Cheese</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>680-910g whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella, freshly grated (170-255g per pizza)</li>
                <li>Grated parmasan for dusting</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start the dough by combining the water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl and let sit for a few minutes. If the yeast goes foamy, it's alive and you're good to proceed (if it doesn't, it's dead and you need new yeast). </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and salt and 5 cups (600g) of bread flour. Mix until just combined, then start kneading. Add just enough additional flour to keep the dough workable (i.e. not too sticky) and kneed until you can stretch some of the dough into a thin sheet without it tearing. (NOTE: You will probably need to add a lot more flour. The quantity I give here is just a base line to get your started.)</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into four equal balls and put them in four containers (ideally glass) and lightly coat the balls and the interior of their containers with olive oil. Cover, and either rise at room temperature for two hours, or put them in the refrigerator and let them rise for 1-7 days. (I prefer the long, cold rise.)</li>
            <li>When you want to bake, put a pizza stone or pizza steel into your oven (mine works best on a high rack position but every oven is different) and preheat to your highest possible temperature, ideally convection, for a full hour.</li>
            <li>For the sauce, simply mix together the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Liberally dust a pizza peel with cornmeal (or something similar). Take the cold dough out of the fridge and dust it in flour. Stretch to the widest size and shape that will fit on your peel and stone/steel. </li>
            <li>Top with just enough sauce to lightly coat the surface. Dust the sauce layer with parmesan, then cover with the mozzarella. </li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza to the stone/steel and bake until the crust is well-browned and the cheese has browned a bit (but, ideally, has not started oozing out an orange grease layer), 6-7 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
